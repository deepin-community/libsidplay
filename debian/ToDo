ToDo list for Debian

* apply patches architecture dependent (especially optimization patches),
  eg. libsidplay-1.36.36-optimize.patch or libsidplay-ix86-optimize.patch
  -> this was introduced in version 1.36.38 and needs to be tested
* solving general packaging or compilation problems, if any
  (there was once ;-) one not reproducable bug reported with package
   building on PowerPC which I closed because the submitter did not
   reply to a couple of pleas for more details)
